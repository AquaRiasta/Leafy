## Technology

This project is created with:
- Dart
- Flutter
- Firestore

## Problems
This is the first project created using the Flutter SDK. All the members in the group had no prior experience in software development. This is simply an UI implementation of the concept. Some functionalities are present; however, the app's architecture is severely lacking. There is no services & controllers, database, CRUD, state management, asynchronous programming - anything that is needed to create a functional app.

## Features

Despite that it is still an accomplishment as this is our first software project ever and it can run smoothly without any error on our test device.

Some of the features available are:

- News compilation
- Events feed & notifications
- Recycling locations
- Quiz & Challenges
- Product review and recommendation
